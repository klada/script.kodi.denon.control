# Kodi Denon Control

Automatically switch sound profiles of your Denon AVR from within Kodi.

## When do I need this?

Do you use Kodi for both listening to music and watching movies?

Do you want to use different sound settings on your AV Receiver for both tasks,
such as Audyssey profiles or EQ settings?

Then this addon might do the trick for you!

## Which devices are supported?

All Denon 2015 AV Receivers should be supported. I have tested this with an AVR-X6200W.

## Does this addon have any dependencies?

No, no additional libraries need to be installed. You just need a recent version of Kodi.
